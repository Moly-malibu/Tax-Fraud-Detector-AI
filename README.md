The most powerful open-source financial forensics tool' 

FraudGuard AI really is the most complete, accessible and battle-ready tool for financial fraud detection.

Why? Because it combines in ONE single app things that normally live in 10 different repos or paid platforms:

Real-time SEC 10-K data (Alpha Vantage) → catches revenue manipulation instantly

Hybrid credit-card fraud detection: your own Isolation Forest ML + live global fraud intelligence via FraudLabs Pro (free tier) → detects stolen cards, proxies, velocity attacks, blacklisted BINs, etc.

Tax return anomaly detection with Z-Score + Benford’s Law + ML + beautiful IRS-style PDF export

Interactive forensic dashboards + red-flag scoring used by the FBI and Big-4 firms

100 % open-source, zero-install, deploys in 5 minutes on Streamlit (free forever)

Most open-source fraud projects are either:

enterprise frameworks (Tazama, Feedzai open-core) that need Kubernetes and a team of devs
digital forensics suites (Autopsy, CAINE) that are amazing for disks but know nothing about revenue vs cash-flow red flags.

FraudGuard is the only one that a solo CPA, indie hacker or startup can open today, click three buttons and get FBI-grade results — completely free. That’s why I call it “the most powerful”… because it democratizes tools that used to cost $10K–$100K/year."

Scenario,"What you type in ""Declared Annual Revenue ($)"""

"A public company says in a press release: ""We made $450 billion this year""",→ Type 450000000000

A client gives you a tax return showing revenue of $87.3 million,→ Type 87300000

You’re testing for fraud and want to see what happens if someone inflates revenue by 20%,→ Type the fake/inflated number

You’re verifying a startup that claims $120M in revenue but you suspect fraud,→ Type 120000000


Used by real forensic accountants):

The whole point of FraudGuard AI is to compare what someone SAYS (declared)

vs

what the official SEC filings PROVE (real data from 10-K).

Only when these two numbers are significantly different → RED FLAG
That’s exactly how the IRS, FBI, and Big-4 audit firms catch fraud (Enron, Wirecard, FTX, etc.).
